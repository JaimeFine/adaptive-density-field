    "The point is exactly what I have talked about. I have no idea where the POIs are, so I have to use data to predict which position is most likely to be a POI, or is there a POI between two timestamp. So I need a threshold (I might have some data about several POI data). I need timestamp because I need to use time and velocity to calculate the expected location in the next timestamp, and see how far it is between the predicted location and the actual location in the next stamp. And use that to predict POIs! Or it can be understood in this way: it is an interpolation, I mask one dot between two dots, and use regression (not necessarily linear) to predict a route, and how far the masked point is from the route determine the possibility of the existence within that route (not necessarily that masked dot)."
